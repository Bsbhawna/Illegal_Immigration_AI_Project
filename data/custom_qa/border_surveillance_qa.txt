Q: What AI techniques were used for border surveillance?
A: We used YOLOv8 and DeepSORT for CCTV footage analysis to detect and track individuals near border zones. Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) helped model crossing routes and predict high-risk areas.

Q: What are the insights from border surveillance data?
A: The top 5 most crowded frames were identified with multiple persons attempting crossing. Frequent crossings occur near porous riverbanks and weak fencing zones.

Q: How was data integrated for enforcement?
A: Data from CCTV, satellite imagery, and social media were combined in the dashboard to assist real-time decision making.
