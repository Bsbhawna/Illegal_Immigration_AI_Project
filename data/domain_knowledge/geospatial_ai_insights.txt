Geospatial AI Insights:

- Satellite imagery (Sentinel-2, Google Earth Engine) monitored 20 km border zones continuously.
- DBSCAN clustering identified recurring hotspots correlated with illegal crossings.
- RGB band analysis helped distinguish human activity patterns from natural background.
- H3 hexagonal clustering improved spatial resolution for border segment analysis.
- Graph Neural Networks predicted likely crossing routes based on terrain and prior incidents.
- Heatmaps generated via Folium and Kepler.gl provided visual dashboards for enforcement.
- AI detected anomalies such as sudden gatherings, makeshift bridges, and campfires.
- Real-time geospatial data pipeline enabled near-instant alerts for border patrol units.

Challenges:
- Cloud cover and dense foliage sometimes hinder satellite visibility.
- Need to fuse multispectral data for better accuracy.

Recommendations:
- Deploy AI-powered drones to supplement satellite data.
- Increase training data for GNNs with live incident reports.
