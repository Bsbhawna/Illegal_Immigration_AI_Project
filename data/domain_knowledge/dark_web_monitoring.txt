Dark Web Monitoring:

- Used Ahmia API and Telegram monitoring to track illegal immigration related chatter.
- Identified underground forums offering forged documents and smuggling routes.
- Keywords tracked: "fake visa", "border crossing", "illegal migration", "document forgery".
- Dark web data highlighted emerging threats before appearing in mainstream channels.
- Alerts integrated with law enforcement databases.
- Continuous monitoring detected shifts in smuggling tactics.

Challenges:
- Encryption and anonymity limit data access.
- High noise in data requires AI filtering.

Recommendations:
- Develop specialized AI models for dark web OSINT.
- Increase inter-agency data sharing.
