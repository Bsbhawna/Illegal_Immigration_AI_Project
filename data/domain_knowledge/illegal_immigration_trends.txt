Illegal Immigration Trends (2014-2024):

- Data collected from NCRB, BOI, and field surveillance reveal a steady increase in illegal crossings from 2014 to 2019.
- Peak illegal immigration years: 2017, 2018, with spikes related to regional unrest and economic migration.
- Annual average illegal crossings recorded: approximately 20,000 to 35,000 persons/year.
- Major source countries: Bangladesh, Myanmar, Nepal.
- Illegal crossings concentrated in hotspots along the India-Bangladesh border in West Bengal, Assam, and Tripura.
- Urban migration of illegal immigrants increased post 2018, linked to employment opportunities and family reunification.
- Risk scoring indicates higher vulnerability in border districts with poor infrastructure and law enforcement.
- Data also shows seasonal trends: higher crossings during monsoon due to reduced patrol visibility.

Insights from Satellite & Geospatial AI:
- DBSCAN clustering identified consistent hotspot zones.
- Heatmaps show corridors with frequent crossings aligning with porous fencing and water bodies.
- Satellite imagery detected unusual night movements, indicative of illegal crossings.

Policy Impact:
- After border fencing intensification in 2019, a noticeable dip in crossings was observed in some sectors.
- Fake documents and visa fraud cases have risen, indicating shifting strategies by illegal entrants.

Further monitoring recommended with enhanced AI-driven alerts and social media surveillance to detect emerging trends.
