Border Crossing Analysis:

- Top 5 most crowded crossing frames identified by CCTV & satellite surveillance: Frames 249, 219, 57, 98, 203.
- Border sectors with maximum crossings: India-Bangladesh (West Bengal, Assam), India-Myanmar (Nagaland), India-Nepal (Uttar Pradesh).
- Frequent illegal crossing detected near riverine areas, where physical fencing is difficult.
- Geospatial AI using H3 clustering and DBSCAN helped in identifying micro-hotspots.
- Graph Neural Network (GNN) models predicted likely crossing points with 78% accuracy based on historical data.
- Seasonal weather and agricultural cycles impact crossing patterns.
- Real-time alerts integrated with local enforcement resulted in 15% higher interception rates.
- Key challenges include terrain complexity, night-time movements, and disguises.

Recommendations:
- Increase multi-modal surveillance in hotspot corridors.
- Deploy drone and satellite AI jointly for night vision.
- Community outreach to reduce local complicity.
