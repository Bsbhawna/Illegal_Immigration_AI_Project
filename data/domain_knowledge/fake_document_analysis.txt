Fake Document Analysis:

- Using OCR, signature verification, and AI-based image analysis, several patterns emerged:
- Forged passports and ID cards often had subtle watermark inconsistencies.
- Signature forgery detection using Siamese networks achieved 80-85% precision.
- AI flagged documents with altered dates and mismatched fonts.
- Fake documents mostly sourced from underground networks across South Asia.
- Increasing use of high-quality counterfeit holograms and laminations.
- Document fraud closely linked with visa fraud and identity theft rings.
- Detected fake documents led to multiple arrests in 2023 operations.

Recommendations:
- Integrate real-time document scanning at border checkpoints.
- Use federated learning to improve AI models with new data continuously.
- Strengthen legal framework for harsher penalties on document fraud.
