AI Models Used and Performance:

- Geospatial Clustering: DBSCAN for hotspot detection, H3 for hexagonal spatial indexing.
- Satellite Image Analysis: RGB band processing, anomaly detection on Sentinel-2 imagery.
- Graph Neural Networks (GNN): Border crossing route prediction with 78% accuracy.
- Signature Verification: Siamese neural networks achieving 85% precision in forgery detection.
- Document OCR: AI-powered Optical Character Recognition for fake document detection.
- NLP Models: GPT-4 and BERT variants for social media and policy text analysis.
- Embeddings: LlamaCppEmbeddings and HuggingFace embeddings for semantic search.
- Real-Time Alerts: Pipeline integrating multi-modal AI outputs for timely border enforcement.

Limitations:
- Cloud interference in satellite data.
- Signature model struggles with very similar genuine/fake signatures.
- Social media analysis requires continuous model retraining due to evolving language.

Ongoing Improvements:
- Incorporation of federated learning to leverage distributed data.
- Enhancement of multimodal AI fusion techniques.
