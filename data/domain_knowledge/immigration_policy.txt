India's Immigration Policy Overview:

India’s immigration policy is governed by the Foreigners Act, 1946, and the Citizenship Act, 1955, among other regulations. The policy aims to regulate entry, stay, and exit of foreigners, balancing national security and economic interests.

Key points:
- Visa issuance categories: Tourist, Business, Employment, Student, and Diplomatic.
- Strict scrutiny for illegal entries across borders, especially in states bordering Bangladesh, Myanmar, Pakistan, and Nepal.
- Emphasis on integration of refugees, with UNHCR coordination.
- Continuous efforts to curb illegal immigration through border fencing, surveillance, and technological measures.
- Special focus on biometric verification and Aadhaar integration for identity validation.
- Policies have evolved to handle increased influx due to geopolitical tensions in neighboring countries.

Recent amendments have aimed at streamlining deportation procedures and enhancing collaboration with neighboring countries for border control.

Global Comparison:
- India’s policy is stricter compared to many Western countries, emphasizing border security.
- Refugee protection is relatively ad hoc, often challenged by local socio-political dynamics.

Ongoing Challenges:
- Managing undocumented migrants in urban and rural areas.
- Human trafficking and visa fraud.
- Coordination between multiple agencies and states for enforcement.
